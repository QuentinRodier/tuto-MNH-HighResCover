    "# Tutorial: Creating a High-Resolution Custom ECOCLIMAP Database from Geoclimate for Meso-NH/Surfex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface discretization in Meso-NH is already possible through ECOCLIMAP, but the resolution is 1km. For realistic simulations requiring a finer mesh, higher resolution surface discretisation becomes necessary. This tutorial provides an example of creating a high-resolution custom ECOCLIMAP database for Meso-NH/Surfex. In the final step of the tutorial, we also show how to achieve the same with topography from any given database.\n",
    "To obtain a high-resolution cartography of surface types, we will use OpenStreetMap data, retrieved using the GeoClimate code. Post-processing steps will be required to adapt the GeoClimate output files for use as input in Meso-NH/Surfex, using the ECOCLIMAP cover system.\n"
